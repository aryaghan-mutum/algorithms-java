Multi Threading:

Definition: It is the ability of a program to run 2 or more threads concurrently, where each thread
can handle a different task at the same time making optimal use of the available resources.

A Java thread can lie only in one of the show states at any point of time

Thread Life Cycle:
New
Runnable
Running
Terminated

New: A new thread begins its life cycle in this state and remains here until the program stats the thread.
It is also known as a born thread

Runnable: Once a newly born thread starts, the thread comes under runnable state.
A thread stays in this state is until it is executing its task.

1. Create a Thread class implementing Runnable interface
2. Override run() method
3. Create object of the class
4. Invoke start() method using the object

Running: In this state a thread starts executing by entering run() method and the yield()
method can send them to go back to the Runnable state.

Waiting: A thread enters this state when it is temporarily in an inactive state ie: it is
still alive but is not eligible to run. it is can be waiting, sleeping or blocked state.

Terminated: A runnable thread enters the terminated state when it completes it task or otherwise
terminates.
